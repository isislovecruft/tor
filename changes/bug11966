 o Minor bugfixes (bridge clients):
   - Add a new bootstrap stage at 18% to signal to bridge clients when
     they are fetching bridge descriptors.  Fixes a problem with
     reporting during bootstrap that the consensus fetch failed when
     really the bridge descriptor fetch failed.  Fixes bug 11966.
